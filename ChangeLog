	Updated Dutch translation.

Sun Apr 20 20:52:16 MDT 2008
	Fixed a problem in the code handling iconv (character
	set translation) errors; if iconv was not working, the
	input string should just be returned without conversion
	(thanks to Alan Post for pointing this out).

Wed Dec 19 11:06:08 MST 2007
	Updated Vietnamese translation.

Mon Dec 10 17:10:08 MST 2007

	Updated Dutch translation.

Mon Feb 12 13:44:03 MST 2007
	gettext update to 0.16.1.

Tue Jan  2 21:25:13 MST 2007
	Patching bug on big-endian platforms (thanks to Volker Weiss).
	This changes the database format (for everybody), so you will
	need to regenerate your indices.
	Patching bug in handling of empty metadata (again, thanks to
	Volker Weiss).
	Releasing doodle 0.6.6.
	
Mon Jan  1 19:10:40 MST 2007
	Added pkgconfig support.

Tue May  2 14:56:42 PDT 2006
	doodled shutdown sequence was broken, fixed.
	doodled used stat instead of lstat, resulting in
	symbolic links being added and then removed from
	the database; fixed.  doodled no longer verifies
	all entries in the database on startup (too costly).
	We assume that "doodle -b" has been used to create
	an up-to-date database and that doodled will always
	run in the background keeping it (sufficiently)
	up-to-date.
	Added out-of-process execution of GNU libextractor.
	This ensures that doodle(d) does not crash even if
	GNU libextractor does (i.e. due to bugs or corrupted
	file systems).
	Releasing doodle 0.6.5.

Sat Jan  7 02:37:53 PST 2006
	Added Swedish translation.

Sun Sep 18 22:14:17 PDT 2005

	Made prune-paths much faster by not iterating over the pruned
	directories (Mantis #926).

Wed Aug  3 11:01:18 PDT 2005

	Updated Irish and German translation.

Mon Dec 27 21:21:35 CET 2004 
	Do not follow symbolic links (in doodled, doodle was ok already).

Sun Dec 26 01:44:00 CET 2004
	doodled debugging.  Added multithreading, code cleanup.  Works much
	better now.  Added conversion of search strings to UTF-8 to support
	libextractor 0.4.0 and higher.  Releasing doodle 0.6.1.

Sat Nov 13 15:00:03 EST 2004
	Added locking (flock) to avoid concurrent modification of the doodle
	DB.  More doodled bugfixes and optimizations.  In particular fine-grained
	modification tracking (per node) and batched truncation.  This
	dramatically speeds up updating an existing database after files were
	removed (O(n) instead of O(n*k) where n is the size of the DB and k
	is the number of removed files).

Thu Nov 11 21:50:01 EST 2004
	Various major bugfixes to doodled and also in doodle
	(with respect to logging).

Fri Oct 22 22:04:32 EST 2004
	Added doodled, a daemon that watches changes in directories
	that were indexed by doodle and updates the database whenever
	files in those directories change.  Highly experimental code.
	Uses libfam.  Releasing doodle 0.6.0.
	
Thu Oct 21 21:55:31 EST 2004
	Major bugfixes in the new code.  The format was again
	changed slightly.  Where in 0.5.0 all offsets were relative,
	this is no longer the case for the special absolute offset "0"
	which is used for termination. Since "0" is not a valid relative
	offset (a node may not point to itself) we do not have to encode
	0 as a relative offset and can just put an absolute 0.  This
	safes a couple of bytes.  Also we did not check if the same
	node was listed (by chance) multiple times for the same filename.
	Again, doing that check costs hardly any time but improves 
	the database size.  For a small testcase we're now down
	20% in DB size from 0.5.0 (270458 bytes vs. 223311 bytes).

Wed Oct 20 21:33:34 EST 2004
	Added multi-link support.  Multi-link support allows
	much faster scanning of the doodle tree by allocating
	n-nodes from the same level of the tree in the same
	block in memory.  This changes the database format
	slightly; the cost and benefits in terms of size should
	roughly cancel each other out (on some test I saw an
	increase of 1.9%).  For searching this should not make 
	much of a difference; single search invocations
	should be minimally slower, on the other hand multiple 
	searches on the same tree in memory should be faster.
	In general, building the database should be significantly
	faster (at least as far as doodle is concerned) since in 
	essence this entails doing lots of searches in-memory.
	Using the proftree benchmark the time for 100.000 
	in-memory 2-searches goes down from 150s to 110s on my 
	machine.

	Did I mention that this feature is highly experimental and
	the current CVS code is thus far from stable (for example
	proftree2 still crashes!) If you want something stable, 
	stick to doodle 0.5.0 for now!

Sat Oct 16 15:32:48 EST 2004
	Added translation to Albanian.  
	
Sat Oct  9 15:31:18 EST 2004
	Added translation to Dutch.  Releasing 0.5.0.

Tue Oct  5 02:05:02 EST 2004
	Implemented logreplay.  Fixed some bugs in swaping code,
	added some more checks.

Mon Oct  4 02:22:22 EST 2004
	Added support for searching multiple databases 
	(like with locate).  Added support for pruning
	paths (option -P).  Updated man-pages and other docs.

Sun Sep 26 17:14:13 EST 2004
	Added support for 64-bit files (database larger than
	2^31 bytes).  Made offsets to other nodes relative
	(reduces DB size since relative offsets are almost
	always significantly smaller).  This is an incompatible
	database format change!  Added option to allow user
	to change the memory limit (8 MB is a bit small for
	very large databases if plenty of memory is available).

Sun Sep 26 16:04:10 EST 2004
	Fixing potential segfault when reading corrupted 
	database.

Tue Sep 14 22:29:53 EST 2004
	Bounding search-string size to avoid quadratic
	complexity for very long meta-data strings.
	
Thu Sep  9 00:29:37 EST 2004
	Fixed bugs, fixed I18N to make it work properly if
	libdoodle is used in applications other than doodle.
	Releasing 0.4.0.

Sat Sep  4 18:38:06 IST 2004
	Changed API (needed to make memory consumption bound
	truely work).  New API should also be more intuitive
	and results in less code.  The Java API did not change.  
	Improved IO by making reads aligned to blocks.  
	Improved copying on expansion to avoid quadratic 
	complexity (in the number of search-strings).  Added 
	benchmark for profiling.

Fri Sep  3 00:50:00 IST 2004
	Added code to reduce memory consumption (by using
	a temporary file and serializing part of the index
	to that file if we cross a certain memory threshold).
	Also reduced memory consumption on 64-bit machines
	by replacing pointers with 32-bit integers.  This also
	improves CPU usage by avoiding sorting and binary
	searches.  Reduced IO (mostly for search) by keeping 
	certain additional values in memory (feasible now 
	thanks to the memory threshold code).

Sat Aug 21 22:52:22 IST 2004
	Added Basque translation (incomplete).

Fri Aug 13 21:00:06 IST 2004
	JNI/Java interface to libdoodle works.  Improved
	error messages and provided complete translation to
	German.  Additional testcases.  Updated and improved
	man-pages.  Releasing 0.3.0.

Thu Aug 12 20:01:59 IST 2004
	gettextization of the package (with gettext 0.14)

Thu Aug 12 19:47:57 IST 2004
	Fixing problem with approximate searches (-i and -a options).
	
Fri Jul 23 20:05:20 IST 2004
	Added -B option.  Added man-page for libdoodle.
	Releasing 0.2.1.

Fri Jul 23 19:11:40 IST 2004
	Split doodle into library (libdoodle) and main binary.
	Logging now done via logger method.  Lots of code
	refactoring and renaming to make library split nicer.

Fri Jul  2 19:51:15 IST 2004
	Removed SHA-1 (now using timestamps instead) resulting
	in slighly smaller databases and significantly increased
	indexing performance.  Database format changed.
	Releasing 0.2.0.

Fri Jul  2 18:48:20 IST 2004
	Added code to avoid printing filenames multiple times
	if multiple keywords match.  Made option -e work when
	building database.  Added option -f for (full) filenames
	as keywords.  Added testcases for io and tree module.

Sun Jun 20 14:34:28 IST 2004
	Fixed segfault.  Added sorting of filenames array
	and cix to speed up database serialization (improves
	speed by a factor of 60).  Checking for special devices
	(char, blk, fifo, sock) added.  Releasing 0.1.1.
	
Fri Jun 11 19:27:11 IST 2004
	Reduced IO overhead (using buffers).  Reduced space
	consumption even further (integer-pair packing, do not
	canonicalize tree more than required, limit split to
	minimum split required).  Fixed various bugs.  Releasing 0.1.0.

Sun Jun  6 19:29:37 IST 2004
	Reduced space consumption (to 57%), added incrementality.
	
Mon May 31 15:36:33 EST 2004
	Re-worked suffix-tree code.  Multiple results and serialization
	now work fine.
	
Mon May 24 19:56:01 EST 2004
	Code prints first result (but only first hit at the moment).

Mon May 24 01:00:51 EST 2004
	Project started.
